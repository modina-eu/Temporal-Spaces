# SOUND DESIGN

Contribution: Max Levy

## Introduction

This text is a documentation of my contribution to Temporal Spaces's Sound Design, both in its technical and creative areas. 

## VCVRack

In working with OSC that would function well with the fast-changing values of movement capture, we settled

## First prototype

This first research prototype produced with ***[VVVV gamma](https://visualprogramming.net/)*** incorporates the basic system of recording in the first instance and replay in the second.

Recording takes the form of a sequence of images that is then played back by an interactive player.

The replay system enables different compositions to be obtained by varying parameters such as the speed at which the recorded sequence is played back or its arrangement in space.
