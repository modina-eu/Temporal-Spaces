## About
Temporal Space is a multimedia dance installation emphasizing curiosity, play, and the exploratory generation of movement via visual and acoustic feedback. Set in a dimmed environment, this project encourages proprioception of the dark, and the interplay between the seen and the unseen, to produce a collective visualization of captured movement and choreography. With no professional performers, the audience assumes the role of dancer, choreographer, and eventually viewer, in a room of interactive zones, each bestowed with unique rules and feedback triggers. Alternating between phases of interacting and observing, the public is able to witness a collaborative result of their captured and altered parameters, then iterate further on their collective inquiry. By leveraging affordable arrays of webcams as infrared sensors, and utilizing AI to parse data through facial, body, object recognition, as well as interpolate captured footage with previous/pictorial references, the project merges the audience’s curiosity and playfulness with AI’s own playful interpretations of movement capture to produce and archive real-time, iterative interactivity as visualized choreography.

Max Levy is a Tokyo-born choreographer and multidisciplinary artist based in Frankfurt am Main. He trained at San Francisco Ballet and performed in America before moving to Europe in 2011. As a soloist at Ballett Staatstheater Nürnberg, he danced notable roles by renowned choreographers, and earned recognition and awards at international competitions. Since 2017, Max works as a freelance choreographer, known for his intersection of meditative processes and charged atmospheres, utilizing performance communication to engage performers and spectators consciously and passively. His recent series “Sleepdancing” explores themes of sleep and attention, engaging audiences to redefine their presence during performances. Levy emphasizes collaboration, empowering artists and performers to contribute significantly to the creative process, ultimately to make work which makes all participants recognize their agency. Levy continues to create choreography while exploring music and visual arts as integral extensions of this work.

## Open-Source Sharing and Documentation:
In the spirit of MODINA’s open-sourcing of technology, and the general importance of sharing knowledge. By providing hands-on demonstrations and sharing code repositories, we want to encourage both dancers and technologists to adapt the concepts we are exploring. Additionally, we will document the process of the project, as well as the archiving of Visualization results, ensuring that the knowledge and insights gained from this project are shared with a wider community.

## Calendar
The 8-week MODINA residency for the development of this project will take place at STL, Tallinn, between 8/1/2024 and 3/3/2024. It has culminate with an artist talk and a public showing the 22 to 23 of february 2024.
